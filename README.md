# CPU
For our project, we have gotten most of the functionality of our ISA to work.
It features a working program counter, ALU, and control decoder which successfully
implements instructions for adding, shifting, branching, loading, and storing.
Program 1 had almost complete wokring functionality.  It was able to set the complete MSW into memory and an almost correct version of the LSW, where p4 bit was the only one incorrect.  If it was not for problems with the branching, then the program would have been able to fuly set at least half of the words into memory.  

The branching was defniitely the biggest downfall to program 1, not the logic itself entirely.

Program 2 had the decoding logic ready, but problems in implementing looping, as well as late design changes to load and store prevented it running successfully.

Program 3 was not able to run successfully due to some late design changes to the
load and store instructions.
