# CPU
For our project, we have gotten most of the functionality of our ISA to work.
It features a working program counter, ALU, and control decoder which successfully
implements instructions for adding, shifting, branching, loading, and storing.

Program 2 had the decoding logic ready, but problems in implementing looping, as well as late design changes to load and store prevented it running successfully.

Program 3 was not able to run successfully due to some late design changes to the
load and store instructions.
